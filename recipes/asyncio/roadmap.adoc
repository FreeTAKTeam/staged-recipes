= Asyncio Package Windows Support Roadmap

== Current Status

The `asyncio` package (version 3.4.3) is a backport of Python 3.4's asyncio module for older Python versions. However, this package has significant compatibility issues on the Windows platform that prevent successful builds.

== Windows Platform Issues

=== Primary Problem
The asyncio 3.4.3 package fails to compile on Windows due to C extension compilation errors. Specifically:

* Missing Windows-specific exception declarations (`PyExc_ConnectionRefusedError`)
* GCC compilation failures with MinGW toolchain
* Outdated C code that doesn't properly handle Windows platform differences

=== Technical Details
* The package contains C extensions that require platform-specific compilation
* Windows builds fail with error: `'PyExc_ConnectionRefusedError' undeclared`
* Compilation errors occur in `overlapped.c` during the build process

== Impact on Downstream Packages

This Windows compatibility issue affects packages that depend on asyncio, including:

* `freetakserver` - A situational awareness server for TAK applications
* Any other packages with `asyncio 3.4.3.*` as a dependency

== Resolution Strategy

=== Recommendation: Deprecate Package Usage
Since Python 3.4+, asyncio is included in the standard library, making this backport package largely obsolete for modern Python versions.

=== Alternative Approaches
1. **Remove asyncio dependency** - Update dependent packages to rely on built-in asyncio
2. **Pin to modern Python versions** - Require Python â‰¥3.4 where asyncio is built-in
3. **Platform-specific builds** - Suppress Windows builds for affected packages

== Windows Build Suppression

For packages that must continue using this asyncio backport:

* Windows builds should be suppressed using conda-forge build configuration
* Users on Windows should be directed to use Python's built-in asyncio module
* Documentation should clearly state Windows platform limitations

== Timeline

* **Immediate**: Suppress Windows builds for dependent packages
* **Short-term**: Work with maintainers to remove asyncio backport dependency
* **Long-term**: Migrate all packages to use built-in asyncio functionality
