= FreeTAKServer Windows Support Roadmap

== Current Status

FreeTAKServer is an open source server implementation for the TAK (Team Awareness Kit) family of applications, providing situational awareness capabilities for civilian and military organizations.

== Windows Platform Limitation

=== Build Suppression Notice
Windows builds for FreeTAKServer are currently **suppressed** due to a critical dependency issue.

=== Root Cause: Asyncio Dependency
FreeTAKServer depends on `asyncio 3.4.3.*`, which is a backport package that has known compilation failures on the Windows platform:

* The asyncio backport package fails to build on Windows due to C extension compilation errors
* Missing Windows-specific exception declarations in the C code
* GCC/MinGW toolchain compatibility issues

=== Technical Impact
```yaml
requirements:
  run:
    - asyncio 3.4.3.*  # This dependency prevents Windows builds
```

== Windows Users - Alternative Solutions

=== Option 1: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Windows users can run FreeTAKServer in a Linux environment using WSL:
```bash
# Install via WSL Ubuntu/Debian
conda install -c conda-forge freetakserver
```

=== Option 2: Docker Container
Use the Linux-based Docker image on Windows:
```bash
# Pull and run FreeTAKServer in Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 freetakserver:latest
```

=== Option 3: Virtual Machine
Run FreeTAKServer in a Linux virtual machine on Windows.

== Resolution Strategy

=== Short-term Plan
1. **Maintain Linux/macOS support** - Continue providing builds for Unix-like platforms
2. **Document Windows limitations** - Clearly communicate platform restrictions to users
3. **Provide alternative deployment options** - Guide Windows users to WSL/Docker solutions

=== Long-term Plan
1. **Remove asyncio backport dependency** - Migrate to use Python's built-in asyncio module
2. **Update minimum Python version** - Ensure compatibility with modern Python (≥3.4) where asyncio is built-in
3. **Restore Windows builds** - Once asyncio dependency is resolved, re-enable Windows platform support

== Migration Path

=== For FreeTAKServer Maintainers
To restore Windows support, consider:

```yaml
# Remove the problematic dependency
requirements:
  run:
    # - asyncio 3.4.3.*  # Remove this line
    - python >=3.7  # Use built-in asyncio instead
```

=== Code Changes Required
* Update import statements to use built-in asyncio
* Test compatibility with Python's standard library asyncio
* Verify functionality across all supported Python versions

== Timeline

* **Current**: Windows builds suppressed
* **Q1 2024**: Investigate asyncio migration feasibility
* **Q2 2024**: Begin migration away from asyncio backport
* **Q3 2024**: Testing and validation on all platforms
* **Q4 2024**: Re-enable Windows builds (target)

== Platform Support Matrix

| Platform | Build Status | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Linux    | ✅ Supported | Full functionality |
| macOS    | ✅ Supported | Full functionality |
| Windows  | ❌ Suppressed | Due to asyncio dependency |
